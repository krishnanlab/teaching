# Learning Online
First, congratulations on surviving 2020! I'm amazed by and grateful for the seemingly limitless courage, hard work, and sacrifice of healthcare workers, other essential workers, and the people who stood up for social justice.

2020 was an incredibly tough year for being a student, care giver (esp. parent of young children), or daily-wage worker -- difficulties that were hugely compounded due to also belonging to a systematically minoritized/underrepresented/disadvantaged group. In addition to these difficulties, my heart goes out to those who also have suffered the loss of loved ones.

I hope you are able to hang on and continue taking all the precautions to keep you and everyone around you safe until there is widespread testing and vaccination.

In contrast to other semesters when I have taught this course, we are going completely online this time and following a slightly different Spring schedule. So, I have made a bunch of adjustments to deliver this course as effectively as possible and I will work on helping you master the course material as best I (and you) can in these circumstances, following the schedule laid out on [this page](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md).

However, let me make a few things clear:
* I am aware that, during these difficult circumstances, we all need a dose of both structure and flexibility.
* Let's strive to keep to this structure and schedule as much as possible.
* Meanwhile, I am always happy to work with you on a case-by-case basis to figure out different assignments, specifications, and due dates based on your specific circumstances/needs.

Below are more details on how we're going to work through this course online.

## 1. Important Links
### Permanent Zoom Meeting ID
The link to the permanent Zoom meeting will be posted on the [course Slack workspace](https://compbio2021.slack.com/). All of you should have invitations to join this Slack workspace in your MSU email.

### All Schedules
A shared google sheet will contain the full schedule for:
- Paper presentations
- Midterm/Final project presentations
- Office hours (appointments)
Again, the link will be available on Slack.

## 2. Zoom Best Practices
* Please use a headphone (if you can) so that we can avoid audio feedback.
* I will _really_ appreciate if you can keep your video on for as many class hours as you can. It is personnaly hard for me to stare into the zoom void and give lectures and lead discussions. Your acknowledgement, questions, and comments together is the wind beneath my wings.
* You are welcome to use the chat feature to ask questions or provide comments. I will make sure I look every once in a while and respond to them.

## 3. Midterm Presentations – March 10, 12
* Use Zoom (or any other software like Loom) to record a 5 min video of your midterm project presentation and submit on Mar 10.
* Assigned reviewers will view the video, provide feedback, and give scores on Mar 11. A detailed rubric will be provided ahead of time.
* All of us will then meet via Zoom on Mar 12 to discuss all the projects. During this time, three others who are not assigned reviewers will ask questions they have prepared.

## 4. Lectures
We are going to use the Zoom meeting room.
* I will share my screen with the lecture slides.
* I will also share the lecture slides beforehand on the class website so that you can follow along better.
* It is more important now (online) than before (in-person) to stop me to ask questions and share your thoughts. If you’re confused about something I’m presenting, it is extremely likely that others are also confused about that. So, you will be helping a lot of people by stopping me to ask questions and clarify things.
* As and when you think of them, you are also welcome to post your questions/comments on chat. I will look through the chat window and answer questions as they come.
* I will pause several times to ask questions and to find out if things are clear. When I do so, I will expect many of you to chime-in via chat to give me brief answers. Based on what I hear/see, I may follow-up with specific individuals to elaborate.
* I will keep my input volume high to ensure that what I’m saying is clear. If I’m at a high volume, you can always turn down your audio; it’s harder for you to turn it up enough if I speak too softly.
* Finally, since it is hard to pay attention to online/zoom lectures on a computer screen, I will also record my lectures as I present them via zoom and share them with you at the end of the day. But, I’m not going to do any slick editing. So, you’ll be subject to the entire zoom session as-is.

## 5. Student Paper Presentations on Fridays
* Check the “Paper Presentations” sheet in the shared google sheet.
* When it is your turn to present, you can share your screen to present.
* The rest of us will listen and provide questions/comments verbally or over chat. I will keep an eye on the chat and help the speaker take questions.
* Remember: presenting remotely over Zoom sitting all by yourself is pretty odd and lonely. So, it is up to the rest of us to encourage each other by engaging with the speaker as much as possible via questions/comments.

## 6. Class Participation
I hope you understand that I’m constantly looking for ways to ensure you’re present and paying attention, and if my instruction is clear.
* Please log-in in a timely manner. I would like to see you listed as one of the participants.
* During each lecture, there will be multiple questions posed to all of you that you will answer using a live online poll.
* Remember that presenting remotely over Zoom sitting all by yourself is pretty odd, lonely, and lacking in nonverbal feedback (nodding heads, puzzled looks, drowsy eyes, etc.). So, when someone is presenting, as listeners, it is our responsibility to encourage the speaker by engaging with the them as much as possible via questions/comments/answers.
* Finally, I am cognizant of the fact that you are at home/residence and each of you will have a unique circumstance in terms of convenience of working environment, other family-members/roommates, childcare/pet-care needs, spotty internet, etc. All of us will fully accommodate any of this.

## 7. Student Hours
We are going to use the same class Zoom meeting to do all our student hours.
* Times will be determined during the first week of classes.
* Go to the “Student hours” sheet in the shared google sheet and put your name down on the day/time of your choice. Naturally, this will be on a first-come-first-serve basis. I will give you a call at the chosen time.
* We will use this same sheet every week. At the end of each week, I will clear this table and it'll be ready for the next week.

## 8. Final Presentations – April 29
* Use Zoom to record a 5 min video of your poster presentation and submit by the due date.
* Assigned reviewers will view the video, provide feedback, and give scores. A detailed rubric will be provided ahead of time.
* All of us will then meet via Zoom during the Finals hour – 12:45–2:45p – on April 29 to discuss all the projects. During this time, three others who are not assigned reviewers will ask questions they have prepared.

>**Mental and Physical Health**  
>Finally, all the physical distancing we are doing to mitigate the spread of infection can lead to a lot of stress. The isolation is not great for mental health and the confinement is not great for physical health. To help you a little in mitigating these effects, here are some additional things we will do as a class.

## 9. Virtual Meetings with Your Learning Group
Take advantage of the in-class learning groups you are part of. I am asking you to meet remotely with your learning group once every week – perhaps on Thursday or before class on Friday – over a video call. You can coordinate the time works for all of you and how you will do the video call. When you meet online, you can:
* Go over the lecture slides for that week and ask/answer questions.
* Discuss the assignment due on Friday.
* Bring unresolved questions to the Friday online class and ask me those Qs.
* Or, just say HI and continue to do your work in the company of your peers.

## 10. Health & Workout
I have created a `#health-workout` channel on our class Slack. Let's use this channel to share our ideas and post our daily plans/goals for keeping up our mental and physical health.
* You can post something at the beginning of the day to motivate yourself and others, and to get help from others to hold you accountable.
* Doesn't have to 100 pushups. Like it is for me, even stretching for 10 min and drinking 1.5L of water is a worthy goal!!

## 11. Fun
I have created a `#fun` channel on our class Slack. Let's use this channel to share your ideas/plans for engaging in a hobby or just disengaging with a Netflix show.
* Keep them coming as when you find/take-on something new – yoga, online multiplayer games, new TV series, anything!
