# Bioinformatics and Computational Biology | Spring 2021

## Description
Welcome to the Spring 2021 edition of **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology**, an introduction to the inner-workings of methods in bioinformatics and computational biology: analytical techniques, algorithms, and statistical/machine-learning approaches developed to address key questions in biology and medicine.

In this course, students will also learn how to formulate problems for quantitative inquiry, design computational projects, think critically about data & methods, do reproducible research, and communicate findings.


## Time and Location
S/L | Info
:------------ | :------------
Schedule | Mon, Wed, and Fri</br>11:00 am - 12:10 pm
Location | ZoomLand

### Student Hours
TBD

I will block these time from my schedule and be present in my office. Couple of things to note:
1. While I'm happy to chat with you in person, many times, just sending me a message on Slack with your questions/concerns might work as well. So, if you have specific Qs in mind, just shoot me a message and let's see if we can resolve it then and there.
2. If you would indeed like to meet in person, please try to meet me during this time. But, don't worry if you can't make it during this window for some reason. Again, just send me a message on Slack and we'll find a time that works for both of us.


## Major Topics
| ... | Biological topics | Computaitonal & analytical topics |
| :- | :- | :- |
| 1. | Sequence alignment & pattern finding | Dynamic programming; Substitution matrices; Fast Local Alignment |
| 2. | Genome assembly & annotation | de Bruijin graphs; Hidden Markov models |
| 3. | Comparative genomics; Phylogenomics | Suffix trees; Tree construction |
| 4. | Genetic variation & quantitative genetics | Statistical inference, Multiple testing; Regularized linear regression |
| 5. | Regulatory genomics | Expectation-Maximization; Gibbs sampling |
| 6. | Functional genomics | Two-sample tests; One-sided Fisher's exact test; Intro to unsupervised learning |
| 7. | Single-cell genomics | Missing value imputation; Dimensionality reduction; Intro to supervised machine learning |
| 8. | Protein structure prediction; Molecular dynamics | Maximum entropy modeling; Molecular simulation |
| 9. | Biological networks | Graph theory; Measuring associations; Network inference; Label propagation |
| 10. | Modeling cellular pathways | Dynamical simulation, State Space, Bifurcation; Discrete/Boolean modeling |
| 11. | Whole-cell models; Digital evolution | Wiring diagrams; Constraint-based modeling; Artificial life and other whole-cell models |

### Primers
In addition to covering the topics above, the course include three primers on conducting a bioinformatics and computational biology project:
* Organizing and managing a CompBio project
* Kickstarting and getting help in a CompBio project
* Presenting data and results in a CompBio project


## Enrollment
Open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Counts toward the CMSE minor, graduate certificates, and dual PhD. Please email Heather Johnson at john1451@msu.edu for an override.


## Prerequisites
Basically, it would be assumed that you:
- know how to code in one of the mainstream languages like Python or R,
- have an understanding of basic statistics and probability, and
- have studied basic genetics, molecular biology, and cellular biology.

**MSU courses that you can take to satisy these prerequisites:** CMSE 201 or CMSE 301-304 or equivalent with programming experience and two semesters of introductory biology (LB 144 and 145 OR BS 161 and 162 OR BS 181H and 182H, or equivalent). Statistics at the level of STT 231 is strongly recommended.

### Recommended Materials
[This document](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/Additional-learning-resources.md) contains links to a bunch of excellent resources for brushing-up your Unix, Python/R, Statistics, and Biology.
