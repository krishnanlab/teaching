# Course Activities and Grading

## Class Participation | ~25% of the grade
Each week is dedicated to one module where we will discuss multiple topics. For each module, Arjun will give lectures on Monday, Wednesday, and half of Friday. Then, a small group of students (based on a schedule determined at the beginning of the semester) will lead a discussion based on a paper relevant to that module.

### Lecture
During the lectures, Arjun will teach critcal concepts while frequently soliciting comments, questions, and answers. Learners will also be asked to engage in group-based activities and discussions following specified prompts.

### Paper discussion
You will also take turns to present the assigned paper during each topic's "Paper discussion" class. Make sure you sign-up.
- Two students together present each paper.
- The presentation should focus on the computational/analytical parts, not necessarily on detailed biological background & conclusions.
    1. What is the problem the authors are trying to solve? [description of the problem along with why it is important]
    2. What are their claims about the _then_ current practices and their limitations? [existing approaches to solve the problem & their pros-and-cons]
    3. What’s their approach? What’s new in it and what is their rationale for it being potentially successful? [description of the *new ideas*, their *merits* in comparison to existing ones, and *rationale*]
    4. What are the major contributions and limitations of this paper?
    5. What are some open questions and next steps (for addressing the limitations)?

Your role as a learner in this class is to:
- Do the pre-class assignments and additional readings.
- Show up to class.
- Work in groups during in-class discussion sessions.
- **Ask questions** about computational or biological concepts (because no one will have the perfect background).
- Correct me when I am wrong.

### Meeting Arjun
Grade points are also allocated for meeting Arjun at least _thrice_ over the semester during the student hours to discuss the project and the lecture materials:
1. Week of Jan 24 to introduce yourself and discuss project ideas, potential mentors, and relevant papers.
2. Week of Mar 14 to discuss project progress, proposal reviews, and revised project plan.
3. Any other time during the semester to discuss topics covered in any particular lecture.

## Assignments | ~25% of the grade
For each topic, you will be given an assignment after the topic's first "Lecture" class on Monday that you are required to work on and submit before beginning of the "paper discussion" class on Friday the same week. Links to the assignment will be posted on this page next to the topic on the [Calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#calendar) and specific instructions about each assignment and what/how to submit will be posted on Slack.

## Semester Project and Presentation | ~50% of the grade
A major goal of this course is to prepare you for performing original research in computational biology, and for effectively presenting your ideas and research. The semester project will serve as the most practical way to do exactly that.

Projects can take any one of the following flavors:
- Design and implement a new computational method for a task in biology
- Improve an existing method
- Perform an evaluation of several existing methods
- Develop a fully-reproducible documentation and codebase for an existing analysis in a paper

### Expected final outcomes
The outcomes of this semester-long project should include:
1. Well-documented code to:
    - Download and process the data
    - Perform the computational analysis and generate all the results
    - Visualize the results as multiple tables/plots
2. Detailed final report containing the following sections:
    - Abstract
    - Introduction
    - Data and Methods
    - Results and Discussion
    - Limitations and Future Directions
    - References
    - Glossary
3. A poster that describes your project - motivation, exact problem, approach, results, discussion & conclusions, limitations & future directions, acknowledgements.

### Project milestones throughout the semester
There are **ten [project milestones](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#project-milestones)** throughout the course that will help you stay on track, enabling you to complete a substantial project.
