# Functional genomics | Assignment + Paper presentation

This week’s assignment and paper presentation are based on this paper:
A module map showing conditional activity of expression modules in cancer
https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1434

Links to PDFs are available on the [class calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#class-calendar).


## Students doing the assignment (aka not presenting)
Read the main paper and the supplement carefully and then submit your answers to the following questions as a single PDF using [this form](https://forms.gle/WK6EqL5RcATdJpfK8) **before class on Friday, March 19**.

1. Data
    - What are the various types of data that were used to perform the analyses showcases in Figure 2?
2. Methods
    - In your own words, describe what are gene sets and explain the procedure for "Identifying arrays in which the expression of gene sets changes significantly" based on the description in the Methods section (Page 1096).
    - In your own words, explain the intuition behind the procedure for "Automatic identification of gene set clusters" in the Methods section (Page 1096).
    - In your own words, describe what is a 'module' (in this paper) and how are modules derived from gene sets (Page 1097)?
3. Reproducibility
    - _Briefly_ comment on the following: i) Does the paper have a detailed description of how to perform the analysis that resulted in Figure 2, enough for you to repeat that exact analysis and reproduce that figure? and ii) Does the paper have source code to reproduce the results in Figure 2?


## Presenters (no need to do/submit the assignment above)
In your presentation, plan to cover the following:
- What are the various types of data that were used to perform the analyses showcases in Figure 2?
- What are gene sets and what is the procedure for "Identifying arrays in which the expression of gene sets changes significantly"? (Methods section; Page 1096)
- What is the intuition behind the procedure for "Automatic identification of gene set clusters"? (Methods section; Page 1096)
- What is a 'module' and how are modules derived from gene sets (Methods section; Page 1097)?
- Explain some key aspects of Figure 2.

In addition to the presentation, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/o9WqGAf5rcaJgNRm9) this form individually to help me understand the roles each of you played in preparing and making the presentation. Submit this form by **11:59pm Friday, Mar 19**.  
_Note: Every member of the group needs to individually complete the form._

### Notes on preparing the presentation:
* No need to repeat anything covered by Arjun as part of the lecture. If a specific topic/technique was covered in the lecture, you're welcome to simply refer to that fact and build on top of it.
* You need to cover only exactly what is being asked and not the whole paper.
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; You’re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
