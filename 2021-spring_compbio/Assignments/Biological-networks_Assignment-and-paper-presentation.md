# Biological networks | Assignment + Paper presentation

This week’s assignment and paper presentation are based on this paper:
Genomic analysis of regulatory network dynamics reveals large topological changes https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02782

Links to PDFs are available on the [class calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#class-calendar).


## Students doing the assignment (aka not presenting)
Read the paper and submit your answers to the following questions as a single PDF using [this form](https://forms.gle/YdD8XnijFNfEtTsD6) **before class on Friday, April 09**.

1. Define a) path length and b) clustering coefficient.
2. Write the computational methods/steps used to generate Figure 1.
3. In your own words, write what Figure 1 shows.


## Presenters (no need to do/submit the assignment above)
In your presentation, please plan to cover Figure 1 and Figure 3 the paper: Genomic analysis of regulatory network dynamics reveals large topological changes https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02782. Specifically, organize your slides to go through in detail each panel of Figure 1 and Figure 3 and explain what's being shown and what is the analytical idea/method that went into each one.

In addition to the presentation, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/JGj5e25JN3RtT9A57) this form individually to help me understand the roles each of you played in preparing and making the presentation. Submit this form by **11:59pm Friday, April 09**.  
_Note: Every member of the group needs to individually complete the form._


### Notes on preparing the presentation:
* No need to repeat anything covered by Arjun as part of the lecture. If a specific topic/technique was covered in the lecture, you're welcome to simply refer to that fact and build on top of it.
* You need to cover only exactly what is being asked and not the whole paper.
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; You’re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
