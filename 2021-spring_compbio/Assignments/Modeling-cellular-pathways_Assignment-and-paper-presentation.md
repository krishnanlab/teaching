# Modeling cellular pathways | Assignment + Paper presentation

This week’s assignment and paper presentation are based on this paper:
Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli https://www.nature.com/articles/35002131

Links to PDFs are available on the [class calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#class-calendar).


## Students doing the assignment (aka not presenting)
Submit your answers to the following questions as a single PDF using [this form](https://forms.gle/aNMsYCDyxJZRgtfp7) **before class on Friday, April 16**.

1. Read the Wikipedia article on [Michaelis-Menten Kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics). Then, explain the differential equation in Slide 11 of 1st lecture this week in terms of the terms of the traditional MM kinetics equation.
2. Consider the system and the equations on Slide 08 of the 1st lecture. Then, explore [Bionumbers, a database of useful biological numbers](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/search.aspx) and identify reasonable values for all the parameters for this system. Cite appropriate pages/sources for each.
3. Read the paper – Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli – and do your best to explain in your own words what the panels in Figure 2 are showing. You don't have to explain how these figures were generated.


## Presenters (no need to do/submit the assignment above)
Your presentation should be based on the paper: Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli https://www.nature.com/articles/35002131.

Specifically, organize your slides to go through in detail:
1. Figure 1
2. Box 1
3. Figure 2

In addition to the presentation, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/NVBu5UUKXwVhTQVw5) this form individually to help me understand the roles each of you played in preparing and making the presentation. Submit this form by **11:59pm Friday, April 16**.  
_Note: Every member of the group needs to individually complete the form._


### Notes on preparing the presentation:
* No need to repeat anything covered by Arjun as part of the lecture. If a specific topic/technique was covered in the lecture, you're welcome to simply refer to that fact and build on top of it.
* You need to cover only exactly what is being asked and not the whole paper.
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; You’re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
