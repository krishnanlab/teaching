# Regulatory genomics | Assignment + Paper presentation

Hi all, here’s my plan for this week’s assignment. Links to PDFs are available on the [class calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#class-calendar).

## Students doing the assignment (aka not presenting)

### Part 1 | Reading assignment; No written work
Watch these videos on Expectation-Maximization and see if you can follow along with each and every step of the calculation for the 1-d example:
* [Expectation-Maximization (EM): How it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REypj2sy_5U)
* [How EM works (part2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQoXFmbXRJA)

### Part 2 | Written assignment
Read this short primer on the EM algorithm that also contains the coin-tossing example that we discussed in class – [What is the expectation maximization algorithm?](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1406) – submit the following using [this form](https://forms.gle/SHvRd4FX8fx7aRkg7) **before class on Friday, Feb 26**.

Then, pick a different `theta_a(0)` & `theta_b(0)` (initial guesses of the biases of coins A & B) and write out all the steps for the coin-tossing example for the first _two_ iterations of the algorithm.

The best way to make sure your understanding & calculations are correct is to choose the `theta_a(0)` & `theta_b(0)` chosen in the primer and see if you can recapitualte the rest of the numbers (the chance of each sequence coming from coin A or B, the table of no.-heads-and-tails for coins A & B, and `theta_a(1)` & `theta_b(1)`).

### Part 3 | Reading and preparation for student presentation
Read this paper on [Practical Strategies for Discovering Regulatory DNA Sequence Motifs](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020036).

No need to submit anything about this in the google form. Instead, read this paper carefully, google keywords & phrases you’re not familiar with or clear about, and bring concrete questions for the in-class discussion on Friday. Contribute one well-thoughtout question/comment – along with your name – in the this week's discussion google doc (lookout for the link on Slack) in your group's section **before class on Friday, Feb 26**.


## Presenters (no need to do/submit the assignment above)
Please plan to cover the paper [Practical Strategies for Discovering Regulatory DNA Sequence Motifs](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020036).

In your presentation, focus on:
* Discussing in-detail all the sections in the paper except “Theoretical Considerations”, which you are welcome to cover at a high-level. (In other words, you don’t have to dive-in and read additional material to explain things in that section).
* Talking about practical aspects & interpretation of results.

In addition to the presentation, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/A1xqxWopcM6J1nBj7) this form individually to help me understand the roles each of you played in preparing and making the presentation. Submit this form by **11:59pm Friday, Feb 26**.  
_Note: Every member of the group needs to individually complete the form._

### Notes on preparing the presentation:
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; You’re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
