# Writing an effective peer-review
I’m asking all of you to review a fellow learner's project proposal. This is an open-review process, which means that both the authors and the reviewers of the proposal know who each other are.

Use these guidelines in two parts to execute your review process.

## Part 1: Giving constructive feedback
We have all heard that, when giving feedback, it is best to keep it "constructive". Well, what does that mean?

Let's begin with what it is not. Constructive feedback does not mean saying something nice before you say something harsh. Though this can soften a blow, it misses the deeper issues in giving feedback. As part of doing science, we have to critique and give/receive feedback often. Since receiving any critique or feedback can be  quite stressful, I want to lay out guidelines that you should follow to make the process supportive and productive.


### _Goal & mindset_

#### Shared understanding
The goal of giving feedback is to achieve shared understanding. To achieve this goal, the feedback must be valuable, actionable, and understandable.

#### Mutual respect
The feedback has to come from a place of respect. Everyone is a decent person doing their best. Therefore, there can be no character indictment. We are more able to act on both positive and negative feedback if it comes from someone we respect, who we believe has our best interests at heart.

#### How can I help?
Doing your peer-review with a helpful mindset sets a good tone. Everyone ideally has the same overall goal: to do a great research project that they’re proud of. This is a goal you can help with as a peer-reviewer by sinking your teeth into the propsed project and focusing on making it better. Think: What can you do to help them?


### _How to do it_

#### Be specific
Specific problems have specific solutions. Vague problems or dissatisfactions don’t have solutions, and they invite frustration or commiseration. Being specific is also the easiest way to avoid character indictment. Stay focused on the specific issue, what might be motivating it, and how it can be resolved. Even if you don’t have a solution in mind, describing your issue as specifically as possible will allow others to help.

#### Keep, Discard, Improve
Giving constructive criticism is like editing: you need to define the stuff to keep (what’s going well?), the stuff to get rid of (what’s not working at all?), and the stuff to fix (what has some value but could be improved?). All of these components are critical. Focus only on the good and you lose the opportunity to improve. Focus only on the bad and you lose motivation.


## Part 2: A potential method of reviewing proposals
* Read the proposal carefully from beginning to end before thinking about specific points to critique. As you go along, you can mark the parts that you would like to come back to. This way, you get a complete sense of the scope and novelty of the work before formulating and offering your critiques.
* Then, move to analyzing the proposal in detail section by section, paragraph by paragraph. For each section, think through the statements the authors are making and see if they make sense to you from multiple angles:
    - Is it logically laid-out and explained?
    - Are their statements backed by references to previous studies?
    - Does it seem like it will work as explained by the author(s)?
    - What are some things the author(s) might have missed that may make their claims weak?
    - What are some additional things you can think of that the author(s) can do to improve their approach? Be careful here to separate what you think is _required_ for the authors to do and what you think _would be nice_ for the authors to do additionally.
* Use clear reasoning to justify each criticism.
* Highlight the good points about the proposed work as well as the weaker points (recollect the ‘keep, discard, improve’ rule).
* Search the web and include citations of papers/articles missed by the author(s). This is often a short but effective way to help improve the proposal.
* Focus on the science and do not worry about typos or formatting issues unless they are major and impeding your ability to understand what’s going on (in which case, you should absolutely bring it up either as a major or additional point; see below).


## Part 3: Writing the peer-review

### Write reviews you would like to receive as an author
Terse, ill-informed reviews reflect badly on you as a reviewer. Support your criticisms or praise with concrete reasons that are well laid out and logical. Take an objective, independent approach to the proposed research work, putting aside subjective feelings about the topic and the authors. Do not push your own opinion or hypotheses.

### As a reviewer, you are part of the project development process
Your comments, when incorporated into the proposal & project, should lead to a better project. You are an acknowledged partner in the success of the project. It is always beneficial to remember that you are there to help the authors in their work.

### Write clearly, succinctly, and in a neutral tone
A poorly written review is as bad as a poorly written proposal. Try to be sure that the authors (and I) can understand the points you are making. A point-by-point critique is valuable since it is easy to read and to respond to. Avoid general comments and, instead, provide specific details. And, when you do that, avoid personal statements by sticking to writing in the third person. For example, you can refer to the person who wrote the proposal as "the author", "the investigator", "the researcher", etc. You should also use gender-neutral pronouns "they/them/their" when neeeded.

### Be sure to enjoy and learn from the reviewing process
All of you have very different backgrounds, training, and interests. This peer-review process is, therefore, also an opportunity for all of you to learn something from each other. Often, a perspective from someone in a slightly different area can be very effective in improving a project.
