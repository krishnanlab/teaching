# Comparative genomics and Phylogenetics | Preparatory checklist | Day09–11

A checklist for self-learning ideas, topics, and definitions that will help you make the most out of the module that is going to be covered next week.

## Algorithms & coding
- [ ] What is the [tree data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))?
- [ ] What is the [big O notation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/big-o-notation)?

## Biology
- [ ] What is the [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome)? What are [chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome)?
- [ ] [How do scientists read chromosomes?](https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/basics/readchromosomes/)
- [ ] What is [repetitive DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_sequence_(DNA))?

### Some cool talks
