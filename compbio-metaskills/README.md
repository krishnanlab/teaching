# CompBio Metaskills

CompBio Metaskills is a discussion on planning, organizing, managing, getting help with, and executing computational projects. To set your expectations, I do not intend to cover any specific tools/methods or teach coding in R/Python. Instead, the focus is on general practical principles and global thinking. The workshop will be conducted in two parts. The topics in each part are outlined below.

## Part 1
* You & your learning
* Methods & software
* Organizing a computational project
* Managing data and code
* Version control
* Programming lang. & software ecosystems

## Part 2
* Examining data & doing spot checks
* Visual exploratory analysis
* Preliminary data analysis
* Writing & debugging code
* Getting help

This repo currently contains the PDF of the slides used in the most recent edition of this workshop.
