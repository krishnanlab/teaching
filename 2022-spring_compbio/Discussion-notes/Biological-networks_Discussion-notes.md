# Biological networks | Paper discussion

This week's paper discussion is on one of the earliest papers on studying the rewiring of gene regulatory networks.


## Papers and resources
The PDF of this article (`Luscombe2004_topological-network-dynamics.pdf`) is available in the [Paper directory](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2022-spring_compbio/Papers/).


## Discussion content and structure
Your paper discussion should cover the following parts, led by one member from each learning group mentioned beside the title. Use this **[shared google slide document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YdyLlPn0OFtD4b_uBJFUYnBXHIWjZ1Gf7ykP9f3QMbM/edit?usp=sharing)** to prepare your presentation. You will be using these slides on **Friday, Apr 08** for the discussion.

### Two important notes
* Absolutely no need to repeat anything I have covered in the lectures. Your discussion should build off of what I've covered. You're welcome to say things like 'Arjun covered this in class' and then talk about the additional things from this paper.
* The sections are, of course, described in text but your slides should not be walls of text or bullet points. Include summarized, sparse bullet points to cover all the ideas and, for each idea, use images/figures/illustrations from other resources on the internet to talk about those points. Make sure to include a citation on the slide for all the external resources that you end up using.


### Part 1 | _Group 1_
* State the title of the paper, when and in which journal the paper was published, the names of the authors, and which institutions the authors are from.
* Then, provide a brief high-level overview of what the paper is about, i.e. what question/problem is the paper trying to address.
* Finally, explain what datasets were used for the analysis whose results are presented in Figure 1a and 1b. To be clear, you're not being asked to explain the results in the figure. Instead, read the _Methods_ section in the main paper and the [Supplementary Material](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnature02782/MediaObjects/41586_2004_BFnature02782_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) to figure out and explain what datasets were used to perform the analyses that resulted in Figure 1a and 1b.

### Part 2 | _Group 2_
Following _Group 1_, describe the computational analyses used to generate Figure 1a and 1b. To be clear, you're not being asked to explain the results in the figure. Instead, read the _Methods_ section in the main paper and the [Supplementary Material](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnature02782/MediaObjects/41586_2004_BFnature02782_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) to figure out and explain what methods were used (to analyse the data described by _Group 1_) to perform the analyses that resulted in Figure 1a and 1b.

### Part 3 | _Group 3_
Explain what is presented in Figure 1a, 1b, and 1c. When you explain Figure 1c, make sure to explain how the numbers tabulated next to 'Size', 'Topological measures', and 'Motifs' are calculataed. Then, explain what are the take-home messages from Figure 1.

### Part 4 | _Group 4_
Describe the computational analysis used to generate Figure 2a. Read the _Methods_ section in the main paper and the [Supplementary Material](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnature02782/MediaObjects/41586_2004_BFnature02782_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) to figure out the details about the data and methods used to perform the analyses that resulted in Figure 2a. Then, explain Figure 2a and it's major take-homes.

## Notes on preparing the presentation
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; Youâ€™re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
