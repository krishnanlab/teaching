# Functional genomics | Paper discussion

This next paper discussion is on one of the first large scale integrative analyses of existing functional genomics datasets.


## Papers and resources
The PDF of this article (`Segal2004_cancer-module-map.pdf`) is available in the [Paper directory](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2022-spring_compbio/Papers/).


## Discussion content and structure
Your paper discussion should cover the following parts, led by one member from each learning group mentioned beside the title. Use this **[shared google slide document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pc7r9PhcTCm18d5CiCrIdIT7ehbWEP0NC0Jolr34fEU/edit?usp=sharing)** to prepare your presentation. You will be using these slides on Friday, Mar 18 for the discussion.

### Two important notes
* Absolutely no need to repeat anything I have covered in the lectures. Your discussion should build off of what I've covered. You're welcome to say things like 'Arjun covered this in class' and then talk about the additional things from this paper.
* The sections are, of course, described in text but your slides should not be walls of text or bullet points. Include summarized, sparse bullet points to cover all the ideas and, for each idea, use images/figures/illustrations from other resources on the internet to talk about those points. Make sure to include a citation on the slide for all the external resources that you end up using.


### Part 1 | _Group 1_
What are the gene sets that are being used in this study?  
What is the procedure for "Identifying arrays in which the expression of gene sets changes significantly"?  
See the _Methods_ section, Page 1096.

### Part 2 | _Group 2_
What is the intuition behind the procedure for "Automatic identification of gene set clusters"?  

See the _Methods_ section, Page 1096.

### Part 3 | _Group 3_
What is a 'module' and how are modules derived from gene sets?  
See the _Methods_ section, Page 1097.

### Part 4 | _Group 4_
What are the various types of data that were used to perform the analyses showcases in Figure 2?  
Explain some key aspects of how Figure 2 is organized, what it is showing, and what are some take home messages.

## Notes on preparing the presentation
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; Youâ€™re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
