# Whole-cell models | Paper discussion

This week's paper discussion is a nice paper on building tissue-specific flux balance analysis of large metabolic networks.

This mini review will help in understanding the approach better: Integration of expression data in genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions \[[Journal](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2012.00299/full)].

## Papers and resources
The PDF of this article (`Shlomi2008_tissue-specific-metabolic-network.pdf`) is available in the [Paper directory](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2022-spring_compbio/Papers/).


## Discussion content and structure
Your paper discussion should cover the following parts, led by one member from each learning group mentioned beside the title. Use this **[shared google slide document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ctr5n2SamY93yJ1AeNmq1F9EbhbgMS06N1NuJmfrNTU/edit?usp=sharing)** to prepare your presentation. You will be using these slides on **Friday, Apr 21** for the discussion.

### Two important notes
* Absolutely no need to repeat anything I have covered in the lectures. Your discussion should build off of what I've covered. You're welcome to say things like 'Arjun covered this in class' and then talk about the additional things from this paper.
* The sections are, of course, described in text but your slides should not be walls of text or bullet points. Include summarized, sparse bullet points to cover all the ideas and, for each idea, use images/figures/illustrations from other resources on the internet to talk about those points. Make sure to include a citation on the slide for all the external resources that you end up using.

### Part 1 | _Group 1_
* Take the class through [Escher-FBA](https://sbrg.github.io/escher-fba/), an interactive pathway visualization tool for on-the-fly flux balance analysis calculations. Specifically, launch the app and simulate the effect of any knockout and describe the effects.

### Part 2 | _Group 2_
* State the title of the paper, when and in which journal the paper was published, the names of the authors, and which institutions the authors are from.
* Then, provide a brief high-level overview of what the paper is about, i.e. what question/problem is the paper trying to address. Use Figure 1 to elaborate on this point.

### Part 3 | _Group 3_
* Explain exactly how the Precision, Recall, and P-value in Table 1 calculated? Describe what is being evaluated, what data are the predictions being compared to, and what precision, recall, and p-value mean in this context?

### Part 4 | _Group 4_
* Describe Figure 3 that shows the prediction of tissue-specific activity of disease genes.

## Notes on preparing the presentation
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; Youâ€™re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
