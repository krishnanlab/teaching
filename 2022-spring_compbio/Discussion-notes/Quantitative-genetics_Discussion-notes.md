# Quantitative genetics | Paper discussion

This week is a chance for you to dive a little deeper into correcting for multiple hypothesis testing by reading and presenting a famous paper that proposed a correction method for genome-wide studies like GWAS.


## Papers and resources
The PDF of this article (`Storey-Tibshirani2003_statistical-significance-genomewide-studies.pdf`) is available in the [Paper directory](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2022-spring_compbio/Papers/)

On the [class calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/tree/master/2022-spring_compbio#class-calendar), you'll also see links to a few other papers that will supplement your understanding of GWAS, hypothesis testing, and multiple hypothesis correction.


## Discussion content and structure
Your paper discussion should cover the following parts and be led by one member from each learning group mentioned beside the title. Use this **[shared google slide document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VA-nFUGferK78eYLkYRPP0uWKGImJnJTSEYVJBoUsfU/edit?usp=sharing)** to prepare your presentation. You will be using these slides on Friday, Feb 18 for the discussion.


### Part 1 | _Group 1_
1. What is the difference between the P-value and the Q-value?

### Part 2 | _Group 2_
2. What are `\pi_0` and `\lamda`? How is `\pi_0` estimated given a value of `\lamda`?

### Part 3 | _Group 3_
3. Why not choose values of `\lamda` close to 0 or 1? Why is `\lamda = 0.5` a generally sensible choice?

### Part 4 | _Group 4_
4. What is the full procedure proposed in this paper for calculating Q-values from P-values?


## Notes on preparing the presentation
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; Youâ€™re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
