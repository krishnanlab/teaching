# Regulatory genomics | Paper discussion

This week, you will be considering the practical aspects of the problem of finding and analyzing transcription factor binding sites.


## Papers and resources
The PDF of this article (`MacIsaac-Fraenkel2006_strategies-for-discovering-motifs.pdf`) is available in the [Paper directory](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2022-spring_compbio/Papers/).

On the [class calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/tree/master/2022-spring_compbio#class-calendar), you'll also see links to a few other papers that will supplement your understanding of discovering DNA motifs.


## Discussion content and structure
Your paper discussion should cover the following parts — described under the section _Motif Discovery in Practice_ in the paper — and be led by one member from each learning group mentioned beside the title. Use this **[shared google slide document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HNOlv3TwuETv3lZAQv6BiRgqhqr12_WqM7GqRCJ9RSI/edit?usp=sharing)** to prepare your presentation. You will be using these slides on Friday, Feb 25 for the discussion.

### Two important notes
* Absolutely no need to repeat anything I have covered in the lectures. Your discussion should build off of what I've covered. You're welcome to say things like 'Arjun covered this in class' and then talk about the additional things from this paper.
* The sections are, of course, described in text but your slides should not be walls of text or bullet points. Include summarized, sparse bullet points to cover all the ideas and, for each idea, use images/figures/illustrations from other resources on the internet to talk about those points. Make sure to include a citation on the slide for all the external resources that you end up using.


### Part 1 | _Group 1_
1a. Provide an overview of the motif discovery workflow (using Figure 1 and related content in the paper).  
1b. Cover the section _Co-regulated genes can be identified in a number of ways_.

### Part 2 | _Group 2_
2a. Cover the section _Some factors affecting motif discovery performance_.  
2b. Cover the section _Using multiple motif discovery programs improves performance_.


### Part 3 | _Group 3_
3a. Cover the section _Recommended methods for scoring motifs_.  
3b. Cover the section _Clustering motifs eases analysis_.


### Part 4 | _Group 4_
4a. Cover the section _Empirical significance testing and cross-validation reduce the risk of overfitting_.  
4b. Cover the section _Phylogenetic conservation information improves motif discovery performance_.


## Notes on preparing the presentation
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; You’re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
