# Course Activities and Grading

## Class Participation | ~25% of the grade
Each week is dedicated to one module where we will discuss multiple topics. For each module, Arjun will give lectures on Monday, Wednesday, and half of Friday. Then, a small group of students (based on a schedule determined at the beginning of the semester) will lead a discussion based on a paper relevant to that module.

### Lecture
During the lectures, Arjun will teach critcal concepts while frequently soliciting comments, questions, and answers. Learners will also be asked to engage in group-based activities and discussions following specified prompts.

### Paper discussion
You will also take turns to present the assigned paper during each topic's "Paper discussion" class. Make sure you sign-up.
- Two students together present each paper.
- The presentation should focus on the computational/analytical parts, not necessarily on detailed biological background & conclusions.
    1. What is the problem the authors are trying to solve? [description of the problem along with why it is important]
    2. What are their claims about the _then_ current practices and their limitations? [existing approaches to solve the problem & their pros-and-cons]
    3. What’s their approach? What’s new in it and what is their rationale for it being potentially successful? [description of the *new ideas*, their *merits* in comparison to existing ones, and *rationale*]
    4. What are the major contributions and limitations of this paper?
    5. What are some open questions and next steps (for addressing the limitations)?

Your role as a learner in this class is to:
- Do the pre-class assignments and additional readings.
- Show up to class.
- Work in groups during in-class discussion sessions.
- **Ask questions** about computational or biological concepts (because no one will have the perfect background).
- Correct me when I am wrong.

### Meeting Arjun
Grade points are also allocated for meeting Arjun at least _thrice_ over the semester during the student hours to discuss the project and the lecture materials:
1. Week of Jan 24 to introduce yourself and discuss project ideas, potential mentors, and relevant papers.
2. Week of Mar 21 to discuss project progress, proposal reviews, and revised project plan.
3. Any other time during the semester to discuss topics covered in any particular lecture.

### Interacting with Your Learning Group
Take advantage of the in-class learning groups you are part of. I am asking you to meet remotely with your learning group once every week – perhaps on Thursday or before class on Friday – over a video call. You can coordinate the time works for all of you and how you will do the video call. When you meet online, you can:
* Go over the lecture slides for that week and ask/answer questions.
* Discuss the assignment due on Friday.
* Bring unresolved questions to the Friday online class and ask me those Qs.
* Or, just say HI and continue to do your work in the company of your peers.

## Assignments | ~25% of the grade
For each topic, you will be given an assignment after the topic's first "Lecture" class on Monday that you are required to work on and submit before beginning of the "paper discussion" class on Friday the same week. Links to the assignment will be posted on this page next to the topic on the [Calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2022-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#calendar) and specific instructions about each assignment and what/how to submit will be posted on Slack.

## Semester Project and Presentation | ~50% of the grade
A major goal of this course is to prepare you for performing original research in computational biology, and for effectively presenting your ideas and research. The semester project will serve as the most practical way to do exactly that.

Projects can take any one of the following flavors:
- Design and implement a new computational method for a task in biology
- Improve an existing method
- Perform an evaluation of several existing methods
- Develop a fully-reproducible documentation and codebase for an existing analysis in a paper

### Expected final outcomes
The outcomes of this semester-long project should include:
1. Well-documented code to:
    - Download and process the data
    - Perform the computational analysis and generate all the results
    - Visualize the results as multiple tables/plots
2. Detailed final report containing the following sections (see the `Final project report` section below):
    - Problems and goals
    - Datasets
    - Computational approach
    - Summary of key findings
    - Challenges
    - Reflections and future directions
    - Acknowledgements
    - References
    - Glossary
3. A final project presentation.
    - This may be a poster if we can do the finals in-person. If not, this shall be a lightning talk. See details below.


### Project milestones throughout the semester

#### 5. Proposal reviews
>Due: Fri, Feb 25
Check out the details below. I’m happy to hear any questions/thoughts you have and happy to clarify anything further.  
Submit your reviews using this form `<LINK>` by **11:59pm Fri, Feb 25**.

_Reviewer assignments_  
Your peer-review assignments are in the sheet ‘Proposal Review Assignments’ under the columns ‘Reviewer 1’ & ‘Reviewer 2’ in the shared class schedule Google Sheet. I will be the 3rd reviewer for all proposals. In that same sheet, you will also find a link to the PDFs of all the proposals.

_Reviewer guidelines_  
_Before_ you dive in, carefully read these [guidelines on writing an effective peer-review](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2022-spring_compbio/writing-an-effective-peer-review.md).

_Review format_ (one per proposal)  
Organize each review based on the following sections:
1. Project title & Full name of Investigator
2. Summary statement: _In your own words_, write a short paragraph of what the project is about (problem/goals), how does the investigator propose to achieve their goals, and what might be the broad significance/impact if those goals are achieved.
3. Major comments and questions: In this section, write a numbered list of critical comments and questions, in the order of importance (highest to lowest). For each comment/question:
    * Indicate the part of the proposal you’re referring to (‘Introduction, page 1, paragraph 3’, ‘Figure 2’, ‘Approach, page 3, paragraph 4’, etc.). It is also useful to briefly quote the specific text you’re talking about (within quotation marks).
    * Justify with clear reasoning as to why this concern is being raised. Within each comment, you’re welcome have nested parts addressing different aspects of the same issue you’re raising.
    * If your critique is based on (the existence of) another paper, don’t forget to include a citation to that paper right within your comments.
4. Additional comments and questions: In this section, write a numbered list of comments/questions that are:
    * Sections/paragraphs/figures that do convey the message but definitely warrant a rewrite or re-rendering for clarity.
    * Things that would be great to include in the project but not critical.
    * Additional thoughts on improving the project beyond the scope of the class.

Notes:
* Make sure you include all three types of comments: stuff that’s good, stuff that’s not working at all, and stuff that is valuable but needs improvement.  
* Make sure you focus on the science and not just on the writing. You can do this by focusing just on asking yourself if the proposal contains answers to the questions laid out in the 'Project Proposal Instructions' [above](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2022-spring_compbio/course-activities-grading.md#4-project-proposal).


#### 6. Mid-course project presentations
>Due: Fri, Mar 18
Record a video your presentation (maximum of 10 min), and submit a link to the video using this form `<LINK>`.

You are encouraged to make a google slides presentation and use those slides to present your project update. You can then use Zoom or Loom to record your video. Then, you can either upload the mp4 file to YouTube as an unlisted file or to a file sharing service like Google Drive or Dropbox and then provide the link to the video via this form.

Make sure to include the following information in your presentation:

* Broad area, some background, and what problem the project is going to address.
* Specific aims of the project, what achieving those aims will result in, and why do these results matter (why are they significant and what impact might they have on future work)
* Description of your approach in the form of a clear flowchart that contains the following information as it pertains to your project:
    - Raw data → Preprocessing & quality control → Preliminary/exploratory analysis → Analysis/Model-building steps → Expected outcomes.

    - Tables & plots to showcase various aspects of your datasets/problem.
* Clear description of your methods and software.
    - Usage & I/O format for each.
* Results from your preliminary analysis
    - With simple baselines, samples datasets, and toy examples.
* As you cover each of the above elements, make sure to mention how you have modified or revised them based on the peer reviews.

#### 9. Final project presentations
>Tue, May 03, 12:45 – 2:45p
You will be presenting a short talk about your project on this day.

Make your presentation using Google Slides and submit the following using this form `<LINK>` before **11:59p Fri, Apr 29**:
1. A link to the slides. NOTE: Please make sure the slides can be viewed by anyone with the link.
2. A PDF of the slides.

Here's are the guidelines for preparing your presentation:

**Duration**  
You will have 10 minutes to present your slides _and_ take questions. So, you should plan to present for about 6–7 min and allow 3–4 min for Q&A. Since the duration of the finals is short and fixed, these allotted times will be followed _strictly_. Therefore, I suggest practicing your talk.

**Content**  
1. Title slide (1 slide)
    * Include the title of your project along with your full name and affiliation (degree/program/department/etc.).
2. Problem and goals (1 slide)
    * What is the problem you are tackling? Why is it important? What goals did you want to achieve?
3. Key findings (1 or more slides)
    * One or more key technical/scientific findings.
        - As I described before, a key finding is something about a particular aspect of your project – the biological problem, data, conceptual idea, computational approach, software, etc – that brought out something new and/or interesting and _helped you learn something new_.
        - Remember that key finding can and should inlcude both _positive_ and _negative_ results/outcomes as long as they were insightful in some way.
    * For each key finding (one per slide), include a figure or table (or something else) that demonstrates the main point, describe the approach you took to get this result/outcome, and what are the major observations/take-homes.
4. Biological/computational concepts and computational skills learned through this project
    * Include a bullet list of some new things you learned on the biology and computational side. These could be concepts, skills, etc.
5. Reflections
    * If you were to start this project afresh from scratch, what would you do differently in terms of the i) problem, ii) data, iii) approach, and iv) code?
6. Acknowledgements
    * Here, mention the full names of everyone who helped with your project at different stages and describe their speicfic contribution. Include mentors, classmates, friends, colleagues, or anyone who helped you make progress in even a small way.

NOTE:
1. Especially during your presentation – and preferably throughout the final exam hour – I would like you to have your video on if possible.
2. All your presentations will be recorded for evaluation purposes.
