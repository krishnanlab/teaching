# Protein structure and dynamics | Assignment + Paper presentation

This week’s assignment and paper presentation are based on this paper:
Evolutionarily conserved networks of residues mediate allosteric communication in proteins https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb881

Links to PDFs are available on the [class calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#class-calendar).

## Students doing the assignment (aka not presenting)
Read the main paper – paying close attention to the methods on Pages 7–9 – and submit your answers to the following questions as a single PDF using [this form](https://forms.gle/Gr6y7NpbnpZLxj3M9) **before class on Friday, April 02**.

Based on your reading, write _short_ answers to each of the following questions:
1. Given a multiple sequence alignment of a number of homologous proteins, explain:
    * What is ‘conservation at a particular position’ mean?
        - Explain in terms of how this will look like in the MSA, and
        - What it mean in terms of evolution and biological function of the protein.
    * What is ‘coupling/covariation/coevolution of a pair of positions’ mean?
        - Explain in terms of how this will look like in the MSA,
        - What it mean in terms of evolution and biological function of the protein, and
        - How is it different from sequence conservation? For instance, can highly-conserved positions in the MSA also be coupled/covarying with other positions in the protein?
2. In this paper, they perform a different type of analysis to calculate covariation between pairs of positions (different from the two methods we discuss in class: one based on mutual information and one based on maximum entropy modeling). They call their approach “statistical coupling analysis” (SCA) originally described in their previous 1999 paper: Evolutionarily conserved pathways of energetic connectivity in protein families https://doi.org/10.1126/science.286.5438.295. Checkout this method in that paper (don't have to read the whole paper; just focus on the SCA method description) and answer the following:
    * Briefly, how does SCA work?
    * Does SCA account for indirect/transitive associations? If so, how?


## Presenters (no need to do/submit the assignment above)
In your presentation, please plan to cover all the aspects of Figure 1 the paper: Evolutionarily conserved networks of residues mediate allosteric communication in proteins https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb881. Specifically, organize your slides to go through in detail each panel of Figure 1 (a–g) and explain what's being shown and what is the analytical idea/method that went into each one.

In addition to the presentation, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/bRBAC7BPZJjbPcZy7) this form individually to help me understand the roles each of you played in preparing and making the presentation. Submit this form by **11:59pm Friday, April 02**.  
_Note: Every member of the group needs to individually complete the form._


### Notes on preparing the presentation:
* No need to repeat anything covered by Arjun as part of the lecture. If a specific topic/technique was covered in the lecture, you're welcome to simply refer to that fact and build on top of it.
* You need to cover only exactly what is being asked and not the whole paper.
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; You’re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
