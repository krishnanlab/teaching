# Sequence alignment & search | Assignment + Paper presentation

Your first assignment is to read and answer questions about an influential algorithm in bioinformatics for sequence comparison called BLAST, described in a paper published in 1990 (link is available on the [class calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#class-calendar)).

As the original paper is really dense, for your assignment and paper presentation, I’m asking you to read the following:
1. A book chapter that describes the steps of the BLAST algorithm in an accessible way ([Mount 2007](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2007/7/pdb.ip41.full)). The PDF of this article along with PDF of all papers assigned in this class are available in the [Paper directory](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/tree/master/2021-spring_compbio/Papers).
2. BLAST Handbook: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK153387/

The two resources will be useful for looking up terminology:
1. BLAST Glossary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST
2. BLAST Practical details https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=BlastHelp


## Students doing the assignment (aka not presenting)
Your assignment is to answer the questions in [this form](https://forms.gle/sfPSbZmNij2Bujot8) and submit before class on Friday, Jan 29.


## Presenters (no need to do/submit the assignment above)
In your presentation, explain how BLAST works based on the Mount 2007 book chapter. There are a bunch of statistical measures that are related to BLAST such as Bit score, E-value, and P-value. I will cover these in class on Friday before the presentation. So, you can assume that these measures will be covered.

### Notes on preparing the presentation:
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; You’re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
