# Single cell genomics | Assignment + Paper presentation

This week’s assignment and paper presentation are based on this paper:
The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells
https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2859

Links to PDFs are available on the [class calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#class-calendar).


## Students doing the assignment (aka not presenting)
Read the main paper – paying close attention to the methods on Pages 7–9 – and submit your answers to the following questions as a single PDF using [this form](https://forms.gle/2h7njkWrvUumzqjt8) **before class on Friday, March 26**.

1. What is the minimum spanning tree (MST) and how is it used in Monocle?
2. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is used for dimensionality reduction instead of PCA. What is ICA and how is it different from PCA?
3. After finding the MST, how does Monocle determine an ordering of all the cells along a ‘pseudotime’ axis based on the MST?

Keep each of your answers to about 250 words.


## Presenters (no need to do/submit the assignment above)
In your presentation, plan to cover the following:
- What is the problem of pseudotime inference trajectory with single cell gene expression data?
- How does Monocle take the low dimensional representation of the data as input and infer a pseudotime inference trajectory?

In addition to the presentation, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/7mU4yUxJADbz2pGDA) this form individually to help me understand the roles each of you played in preparing and making the presentation. Submit this form by **11:59pm Friday, Mar 26**.  
_Note: Every member of the group needs to individually complete the form._


### Notes on preparing the presentation:
* No need to repeat anything covered by Arjun as part of the lecture. If a specific topic/technique was covered in the lecture, you're welcome to simply refer to that fact and build on top of it.
* You need to cover only exactly what is being asked and not the whole paper.
* Use other resources beyond the paper to illustrate the problem, including illustrations, etc. Provide citations for the source materials on the slide.
* Avoid directly using dense figures directly from papers/other-sources. Instead, split complex multi-part figures in the paper into several slides; Capture/zoom-into parts of figure & annotate with boxes/arrows.
* Avoid large blocks of text. Convert methods to flowcharts & annotate flowcharts.; You’re welcome to draw neatly on paper & photograph it.
* Be prepared to define phrases/terminology on your slide.; Google it, read-up; No problem if any idea/concept is still unclear even after reading. Just bring it up in class & we can discuss.
