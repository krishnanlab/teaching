# Genome assembly and annotation | Preparatory checklist | Day06â€“08

A checklist for self-learning ideas, topics, and definitions that will help you make the most out of the module that is going to be covered next week.

## Algorithms & coding
- [ ] What is dynamic programming?

## Biology
- [ ] [What are DNA and genes?](https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/basics/dna)
- [ ] What is the [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome)? What are [chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome)?
- [ ] [How do scientists read chromosomes?](https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/basics/readchromosomes/)
- [ ] What is [repetitive DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_sequence_(DNA))?
- [ ] What is the [structure of a gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene#Structure)? Read more about the [anatomy of a gene](https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/basics/geneanatomy/).

### Some cool talks
