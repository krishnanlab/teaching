## Description
This course is an introduction to contemporary topics in bioinformatics and computational biology, dealing with combining large-scale data and modern analytical techniques to gain biological/biomedical insights. In each topic, centered around a recent paper, we will discuss the major biological & biomedical questions, explore the relevant molecular/genomics/biomedical datasets, and understand the underlying statistical, probabilistic, & machine-learning approaches.

Students will learn how to formulate problems for quantitative inquiry, design computational projects, understand and think critically about data & methods, communicate research findings, perform reproducible research, and practice open science. Students will apply all these by carrying out a project, presenting their project in class, and submit a report at the end of the course.

**Note**  
Open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Counts toward the CMSE minor, graduate certificates, and dual PhD. Please email Heather Johnson at john1451@msu.edu for an override.

**Prerequisites**  
CMSE 201 or CMSE 301-304 or equivalent with programming experience and two semesters of introductory biology (LB 144 and 145 OR BS 161 and 162 OR BS 181H and 182H, or equivalent).
Statistics at the level of STT 231 is strongly recommended.

Basically, it would be assumed that you:
- know how to code in one of the mainstream languages like Python or R,
- have an understanding of basic statistics and probability, and
- have studied basic genetics, molecular biology, and cellular biology.

### Office Hours
TBD

I will block this time from my schedule and be present in my office.

Couple of things to note:
1. While I'm happy to chat with you in person, many times, just sending me a message on Slack with your questions/concerns might work as well. So, if you have specific Qs in mind, just shoot me a message and let's see if we can resolve it then and there.
2. If you would indeed like to meet in person, please try to meet me during this time. But, don't worry if you can't make it during this window for some reason. Again, just send me a message on Slack and we'll find a time that works for both of us.

## Website and Communication

### Course website
This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/tree/master/2019-spring_compbio) will serve as the course website.  

### Communication
The primary mode of communication in this course (including major announcements), will be the course Slack account [TBD]. All of you should have invitations to join this account in your MSU email.  

**Emails**  
Although the bulk of the communication will take place via Slack, at times (rarely), we will send out important course information via email. This email is sent to your MSU email address (the one that ends in “@msu.edu”). You are responsible for all information sent out to your University email account, and for checking this account on a regular basis.

## Course Activities

### Pre-class Assignments
For each topic, you will be assigned a paper after the topic's "lecture" class that you are required to read. The link to the PDF of the paper will be posted on this page next to the topic on the [Calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/tree/master/2019-spring_compbio#calendar) along with instructions on a specific analysis in the paper you should pay special attention to.

You are required to turn-in a 1-page report containing the following:

Critical and thorough analysis of a specific section/figure.
It should contain the following four sections:
1. _Data_
    - What data did they use to perform the analysis presented in the figure?
    - Where did each piece of data come from?
2. _Methods_
    - What techniques and algorithms did they use?
    - Does the paper have a detailed description of how to perform this analysis, enough for someone to repeat that analysis?
    - Does the paper have source code to reproduce the presented results?
3. _Evaluation_
    - What are the measures/metrics plotted for each figure panel?
    - How is the success of each analysis evaluated?
4. _Conclusions_
    - Are the conclusions you draw from the figure in agreement with those drawn by the authors?

This report is due _before_ the topic's "Paper discussion" class. Points will be deducted for reports shorter or longer than two-pages. Wrong papers will be graded as zero.

### Class Participation
In general:
- Do the pre-class assignments and additional readings.
- Show up to class.
- Work in groups during in-class discussion sessions.
- No one will have the perfect background: **Ask questions** about computational or biological concepts.
- Correct me when I am wrong.

#### Paper discussion
You will also take turns to present the assigned paper during each topic's "Paper discussion" class. Make sure you sign-up.
- Two students together present each paper.
- The presentation should focus on the computational/analytical parts, not necessarily on detailed biological background & conclusions.
    1. What is the problem the authors are trying to solve? [description of the problem along with why it is important]
    2. What are their claims about the _then_ current practices and their limitations? [existing approaches to solve the problem & their pros-and-cons]
    3. What’s their approach? What’s new in it and what is their rationale for it being potentially successful? [description of the *new ideas*, their *merits* in comparison to existing ones, and *rationale*]
    4. What are the major contributions and limitations of this paper?
    5. What are some open questions and next steps (for addressing the limitations)?
- The two students will also make a note of all the points discussed in the class during the presentation, write-up them up by working with me, and post the discussion on [PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/).

### Scribing
Each topic's "Lecture" class will have two dedicated scribes who will take notes on the lecture, work with Arjun to refine the notes, and circulate a final version to the rest of the class.
- We will use [stackedit](https://stackedit.io) + Google Drive to create notes and then publish them on GitHub.
- Scribes should submit their _individually completed_ drafts of their notes within 3 days after lecture. I will read those notes and give comments/suggestions.
- The two scribes should then work together to combine their drafts+comments into a single final scribe notes and submit within 6 days after lecture.

### Semester Project and Presentation
A major goal of this course is to prepare you for performing original research in computational biology, and for effectively presenting your ideas and research. The semester project will serve as the most practical way to do exactly that.

Projects can take any one of the following flavors:
- Design and implement a new computational method for a task in biology
- Improve an existing method
- Perform an evaluation of several existing methods
- Develop a fully-reproducible documentation and codebase for an existing analysis in a paper

The outcomes of this semester-long project should include:
1. Well-documented code to:
    - download and process the data
    - perform the computational analysis and generate all the results
    - visualize the results as various plots
2. Detailed final report containing the following sections:
    - Abstract
    - Introduction
    - Data and Methods
    - Results and Discussion
    - Limitations and Future Directions
    - References
3. A poster that describes your project - motivation, exact problem, approach, results, discussion & conclusions, limitations & future direcrtions, acknowledgements.

There are several [project deadlines](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/tree/master/2019-spring_compbio#project-deadlines) throughout the course that will help you stay on track, allowing you to complete a substantial project.
1. Describe your previous research, areas of research interest in bioinformatics / computational-biology, type of project that best fits your interests. Post this description in a profile that lets your classmates know you. Project profile due **W Jan 16**.
2. Discuss with Arjun (and any other PI) and read recent papers. Briefly describe project ideas. Project topic due **F Feb 01**.
3. Prepare a two-page pre-proposal (Page1: text; Page2: figures & references). Project pre-proposal due **W Fri 08**.
4. Write 5-page proposal describing project goals, division of work, milestones, datasets, and challenges. Project proposal due **W Feb 20**.
5. Review proposals. Discuss proposal with Arjun. Reviews due **F Mar 01**.
6. Mid-course project presentations on **M Mar 11**, **W Mar 13**, and **F Mar 15**.
7. Address peer evaluations, revise aims, scope, list of final goals & deliverables. Meet with Arjun. Response is due 3 days after mid-course presentation: **Th Mar 14**, **Sa Mar 16**, or **M Mar 18**.
8. Continue making substantial progress on proposed milestones. Write the first-draft of final report. Meet Arjun to discuss all results and get feedback on the draft. Mid-course project report due **F Mar 29**.
9. Complete milestones, finalize results, figures, write-up in conference publication format. As part of the report, comment on your overall project experience. Final project report due **F Apr 26**.
10. Final project presentations will take place on **M Apr 29**.

## Attendance, Conduct, Honesty, and Accommodations

### Class Attendance
This class is heavily based on material presented and worked on in class, and it is critical that you attend and participate fully every week! Therefore, class attendance is absolutely required. An unexcused absence will result in zero points for the day. Arriving late or leaving early without prior arrangement with the instructor of your session counts as an unexcused absence. Note that if you have a legitimate reason to miss class (such as job, graduate school, or medical school interviews), you must arrange this ahead of time to be excused from class. Three unexcused absences will result in the reduction of your grade by one step (e.g., from 4.0 to 3.5), with additional absences reducing your grade further at the discretion of the course instructor.

### Code of Conduct
All conduct should serve the singular goal of sustain a friendly, supportive, and fun environment where we can do our best work and have a great time doing it.
* Do work that you’re proud of, from the smallest piece of code to the entire project.
* Be supportive of your classmates; respect each others' strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.
* Communicate openly & respectfully with everyone in the class.
* Ask for help; at the same time, respect and appreciate others' time and effort.

Respectful and responsible behavior is expected at all times, which includes not interrupting other students, turning your cell phone off, refraining from non-course-related use of electronic devices, and not using offensive or demeaning language in our discussions. Flagrant or repeated violations of this expectation may result in ejection from the classroom, grade-related penalties, and/or involvement of the university Ombudsperson.

I am unequivocally dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We will not tolerate harassment of colleagues in any form. Behaviors that could be considered discriminatory or harassing, or unwanted sexual attention, will not be tolerated and will be immediately reported to the appropriate MSU office (which may include the MSU Police Department).

### Academic honesty
Intellectual integrity is the foundation of the scientific enterprise. In all instances, you must do your own work and give proper credit to all sources that you use in your papers and oral presentations – any instance of submitting another person's work, ideas, or wording as your own counts as plagiarism. This includes failing to cite any direct quotations in your essays, research paper, class debate, or written presentation. The MSU College of Natural Science adheres to the policies of academic honesty as specified in the General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, and in the all-University statement on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide. Students who plagiarize will receive a 0.0 in the course. In addition, University policy requires that any cheating offense, regardless of the magnitude of the infraction or punishment decided upon by the professor, be reported immediately to the dean of the student's college.

It is important to note that **plagiarism in the context of this course includes, but is not limited to**, directly copying another student's solutions to in-class or homework problems; copying materials from online sources, textbooks, or other reference materials without citing those references in your source code or documentation, or having somebody else do your pre-class work, in-class work, or homework on your behalf. Any work that is done in collaboration with other students should state this explicitly, and have their names as well as yours listed clearly.

More broadly, we ask that students adhere to the Spartan Code of Honor academic pledge, as written by the Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU): "As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do."

### Accomodations
If you have a university-documented learning difficulty or require other accommodations, please provide me with your VISA as soon as possible and speak with me about how I can assist you in your learning.  If you do not have a VISA but have been documented with a learning difficulty or other problems for which you may still require accommodation, please contact MSU’s Resource Center for People with Disabilities (355-9642) in order to acquire current documentation.
