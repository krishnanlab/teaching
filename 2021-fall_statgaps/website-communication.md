# Website and Communication

## Course website
This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/edit/master/2021-fall_statgaps) will serve as the course website.  

## Communication
### Slack will be the primary mode of communication
The primary mode of communication in this course (including major announcements), will be the [course Slack account](https://statgaps2021.slack.com). All of you should have invitations to join this account in your MSU email.  

**Emails**  
Although the bulk of the communication will take place via Slack, at times (rarely), we will send out important course information via email.
