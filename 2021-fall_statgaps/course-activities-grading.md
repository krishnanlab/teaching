# Course Activities and Grading

### Assignments
For each topic, you will be assigned reading materials and, occassionaly, a coding assignment. The links to these materials will be posted on this page next to the topic on the [Calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-fall_statgaps/README.md#calendar) and instructions will be provided on Slack.

Each completed assignment is due _before_ the next class.


### Class Participation
In general:
- Do the assignments and additional readings.
- Show up to class.
- Work in groups during in-class discussion sessions.
- No one will have the perfect background: **Ask questions** about statistical or programming concepts.
- Contribute to the materials in-class and on slack.
- Correct me when I am wrong.
