# Philosophy, Presence, Conduct, Honesty, and Accommodations

## Teaching Philosophy
The cornerstone of my teaching philosophy is to consider each class as an inclusive collaborative learning community where we can all work together to enhance each other's learning. To foster this community, my goal is to make sure that our class is a space where all of you can join in, breathe, be seen & heard, be curious, and openly engage with the ideas.

You absolutely belong in this community and you will be valued and respected. My point of view is as follows:
* _Past_: Your unique background, training, and life experiences are your strengths that I and others can always learn from.
* _Present_: You have a life much bigger and multifaceted than your academic life within classrooms.
* _Future_: You are going to be my future colleagues within or outside academia.

Finally, I design and teach classes that maximize my learning and help me identify gaps in my knowledge and find better ways of discussing each of the many complex/interesting ideas.

In service of these goals, below are all the policies we will follow. If you have a concern about the policies and procedures of this class, please contact me.

## Class Presence
First, if you sincerely engage with the class and put in earnest effort, you will do well. Your can do so by:
- Completing any pre-class readings.
- Showing up to the class on time and staying for the whole two hours.
- Responding to prompts from Arjun that punctuate the lectures: questions, polls, etc.
- Asking questions about statistical or practical concepts (because no one will have the perfect background).
- Working in groups when asked.
- Correcting me when I am wrong.

For these activities to truly result in learning and betterment, I need everyone's contribution to ensure that this class (and all its affiliated spaces including Slack) remain a psychologically safe environment where:
* If learners make a mistake, others (me included) will not penalize or think less of them for it, and
* Others will not resent or humiliate them when they ask for help or information.

I expect everyone to respect and trust each other so that every learner is imbued with the confidence that the group won't embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up. To sustain this environment, all of us will listen, stay curious, and be honest while staying away from judgement, unsolicited advice giving, and interrupting.

### Attendance
Now, all the above activities are heavily based on material presented and worked on in class. So, it is critical that you attend and participate fully every week. Consistent class presence and participation is required to do well in this course.

If you have a legitimate reason to miss class – such as job/grad-school/medical-school interviews, health/medical needs, or any other hard life circumstances – just let me know as soon as you can. I will _always_ be willing to work with you to figure out how to accommodate your constraints/circumstances and how you may makeup for any lost time/points if needed. Same goes for meeting the multiple assignment deadlines. I know that things are pretty tough now. So, just keep me posted and I will support you.

If there are multiple absences without _any_ notice or explanation, that will result reduction in points allocated for attendance. Similarly, not completing assignment or project milestones without _any_ notice/explanation will result in reduction of points at the discretion of the instructor.

## Code of Conduct
All conduct should serve the singular goal of sustaining a friendly, respectful, supportive, and fun environment where we can do our best work and have a great time doing it.
* Do work that you’re proud of, anything from participating in a class activity to completing a full-blown research project.
* Be supportive of your classmates; respect each others' strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.
* Communicate openly & respectfully with everyone in the class. We can all begin by using the correct name and pronouns for everyone in this class.
* When you ask for help from your fellow learners, respect and appreciate their time and effort.

Respectful and responsible behavior is expected at all times, which includes not interrupting other students, turning your cell phone off, refraining from non-course-related use of electronic devices, and not using offensive or demeaning language in our discussions. Flagrant or repeated violations of this expectation may result in ejection from the classroom/session, grade-related penalties, and/or involvement of the university Ombudsperson.

I am unequivocally dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). I will not tolerate harassment of colleagues in any form. Behaviors that could be considered discriminatory or harassing, or unwanted sexual attention, will not be tolerated and will be immediately reported to the appropriate MSU office (which may include the MSU Police Department).

### Discussing or Raising Concerns
If you experience, observe, or just want to talk through anything in regard to your or anyone else's safety and well-being, talk to me. I will not tolerate any discrimination or harassment. You can rest assured that you can come to me and I will listen and I will believe. I will support you and advocate for you with everthing within my power.

Note that, as a member of the university community, I have the responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination. If you would rather share information about sexual harassment, sexual violence or discrimination to a confidential employee who does not have this reporting responsibility, you can find a list of those individuals [here](https://centerforsurvivors.msu.edu/education-resources/index.html). I especially recommend the [Office of the University Ombudsperson](https://ombud.msu.edu/) that offers students a confidential and impartial place to discuss academic and nonacademic concerns. Staff in this office will assist you to define problems, explore options, outline strategies, review policies, find resources, and manage expectations while upholding the values of respect, integrity, diversity and freedom from bias or harassment.

### Chosen name and Pronoun
All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. Many people do not identify with the name on their birth certificate, school ID, or other forms of identification. At the beginning of this class, everyone indicates the name they use and their pronouns. If you would like to change your name, you can do that through StuInfo. Your gender marker can be changed by filing a request at the Office of the Registrar at the Hannah Administration Building. More information about MSU’s preferred name policy can be found at: https://lbgtrc.msu.edu/trans-msu/msu-preferred-name-policy/. Please advise me at any point if you need to update your name and/or pronouns in my records.

## Mental and Physical Health
University life, undergraduate/graduate studies, research, living away from home, and personal relationships – any of these can spring formidable challenges to our mental well-being in unsuspecting, surprising ways, nothing to say of **the isolation and anxiety in the middle of a pandemic and volatile socio-political climate**. Plus, the confinement is not good for your physical health.

To mitigate these ill effects, I hope you are able to make time to take care of yourself (socialize remotely, exercise, eat healthy, sleep, blow off steam, etc.). I also hope that when you feel low, when your physical/mental wellness is being put to test, you will talk to a friend, a friendly colleague, or a close family member.

I also welcome you to talk to me. You can come to me anytime with any challenge you face and I will listen. I will do my best to learn about any issue you have (without any judgement, I promise), keep anything you share confidential, and offer my thoughts based on my experience. It is my wish, duty, and privilege to be of help in any way to ensure your mental (& physical) well-being so that you can get a great education and have a good time doing it.

Finally, I urge you to take advantage of many resources available on campus to support your health and wellness including the [Counseling and Psychiatric Services](https://caps.msu.edu/). They are virtual now and hence, easy to reach out to.

## Pandemic
First, congratulations on surviving 2020 and 2021! I'm amazed by and grateful for the seemingly limitless courage, hard work, and sacrifice of healthcare workers, other essential workers, and the people who stood up for social justice.

These two years have been incredibly tough for students, care givers (esp. parents of young children), and daily-wage workers -- difficulties that were hugely compounded due to also belonging to systematically minoritized/underrepresented/disadvantaged groups. In addition to these difficulties, my heart goes out to those who also have suffered the loss of loved ones.

I hope you are vaccinated and taking all the precautions to keep you and everyone around you safe.

However, let me make a few things clear:
* I am aware that, during these difficult circumstances, we all need a dose of both structure and flexibility.
* Let's strive to keep to this structure and schedule as much as possible.
* Meanwhile, I am always happy to work with you on a case-by-case basis to figure out different assignments, specifications, and due dates based on your specific circumstances/needs.

## Learning Online
There is a permanent Zoom meeting (posted on the [course Slack workspace](https://statgaps2021.slack.com/)), which anyone can use to attend the classes remotely. All of you should have invitations to join this Slack workspace in your MSU email.

### Zoom Best Practices
* Please log-in in a timely manner.
* Please use a headphone (if you can) so that we can avoid audio feedback.
* I will _really_ appreciate if you can keep your video on for as many class hours as you can. Your acknowledgement, questions, and comments together is the wind beneath my wings. Having said that, I am cognizant of the fact that you may be at your residence or in a common area and each of you will have a unique circumstance in terms of convenience of working environment, other family-members/roommates, childcare/pet-care needs, spotty internet, etc. All of us will fully accommodate any of this.
* As I'm giving the lecture in-person, I will not be able to do justice to monitoring the Chat window for questions. So, please unmute yourself and speak-up to ask questions and provide your comments/answers.


## Academic Honesty
Intellectual integrity is the foundation of the scientific enterprise. In all instances, you must do your own work and give proper credit to all sources that you use in your papers and oral presentations – any instance of submitting another person's work, ideas, or wording as your own counts as plagiarism. This includes failing to cite any direct quotations in your essays, research paper, class debate, or written presentation. The MSU College of Natural Science adheres to the policies of academic honesty as specified in the General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, and in the all-University statement on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide. Students who plagiarize will receive a 0.0 in the course. In addition, University policy requires that any cheating offense, regardless of the magnitude of the infraction or punishment decided upon by the professor, be reported immediately to the dean of the student's college.

It is important to note that **plagiarism in the context of this course includes, but is not limited to**, directly copying another student's solutions to in-class or homework problems; copying materials from online sources, textbooks, or other reference materials without citing those references in your source code or documentation, or having somebody else do your pre-class work, in-class work, or homework on your behalf. Any work that is done in collaboration with other students should state this explicitly, and have their names as well as yours listed clearly.

More broadly, we ask that students adhere to the Spartan Code of Honor academic pledge, as written by the Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU): "As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do."

## Accommodations
If you have a university-documented learning difficulty or require other accommodations, please provide me with your VISA as soon as possible and speak with me about how I can assist you in your learning.  If you do not have a VISA but have been documented with a learning difficulty or other problems for which you may still require accommodation, please contact MSU’s Resource Center for People with Disabilities (at 517-884-RCPD or on the [web](https://rcpd.msu.edu)) in order to acquire current documentation.
