## Description
This is an advanced short (1-credit) course designed to:
1) Discuss common misunderstandings & typical errors in the practice of statistical data analysis.
2) Provide a mental toolkit for critically thinking about statistical methods and results.

Classes will involve lectures, discussions, hands-on exercises, and homework about concepts critical to the day-to-day use and consumption of quantitative/computational techniques for working with data.

**Note**  
Open to both undergraduate and graduate students for credit. Counts toward DS Major, CMSE minor, graduate certificates, and dual PhD. Please email Heather Johnson at john1451@msu.edu if you need an override.  
Postdocs, staff scientists/specialists, and faculty members are welcome to sit-in. (Please fill-out the [sign-up form](bit.ly/statgaps2021_signup).)

### Prerequisites
To get the most out of this course, it would be ideal if you have:
1) Familiarity with introductory statistics and probability, and
2) Basic experience with data wrangling, analysis, and visualization using R or Python.

Please check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-fall_statgaps/frequently-asked-questions.md) to see the thinking behind these two prerequisites.

Check out some [recommended online preparatory materials](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/tree/master/2021-fall_statgaps/preparatory-materials.md) that you can use to refresh these concetps and skills.

#### Course Suggestions
* For introductory courses in statistics, please checkout a number of good ones offered in STT. Statistics at the level of STT 231 is strongly recommended.
* If you would like introdocutory courses in programming (in R or Python) and in how to do statistical analysis in R or Python, please ckeckout CMSE 201-202 or CMSE 890 301-304.
* Some background in introductory biology would also be nice, for instance LB 144 and 145 OR BS 161 and 162 OR BS 181H and 182H, or equivalent.

### Hours for Offline Discussion
TBD

I will block these times from my schedule and be present on zoom.

Couple of things to note:
1. While I'm happy to chat with you, many times, just sending me a message on Slack with your questions/concerns might work as well. So, if you have specific Qs in mind, just shoot me a message and let's see if we can resolve it then and there.
2. If you would indeed like to meet, please try to meet me during this time. But, don't worry if you can't make it during this window for some reason. Again, just send me a message on Slack and we'll find a time that works for both of us.
