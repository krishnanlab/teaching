## Description
This is an advanced short (1-credit) course designed to:
1) Discuss common misunderstandings & typical errors in the practice of statistical data analysis.
2) Provide a mental toolkit for critically thinking about statistical methods and results.

Classes will involve lectures, discussions, hands-on exercises, and homework about concepts critical to the day-to-day use and consumption of quantitative/computational techniques for working with data.

**Note**  
Open to both undergraduate and graduate students for credit. Counts toward DS Major, CMSE minor, graduate certificates, and dual PhD. Please email Heather Johnson at john1451@msu.edu if you need an override.  

### Prerequisites
To get the most out of this course, it would be ideal if you have:
1) Familiarity with introductory statistics and probability, and
2) Basic experience with data wrangling, analysis, and visualization using R or Python.

Please check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-fall_statgaps/frequently-asked-questions.md) to see the thinking behind these two prerequisites, staistics course suggestions, and pointers to free online preparatory materials.

### Hours for Offline Discussion
3–3:30p on Thursday and Friday.

I will block these times from my schedule and be present on zoom.

Couple of things to note:
1. While I'm happy to chat with you, many times, just sending me a message on Slack with your questions/concerns might work as well. So, if you have specific Qs in mind, just shoot me a message and let's see if we can resolve it then and there.
2. If you would indeed like to meet, please try to meet me during this time. But, don't worry if you can't make it during this window for some reason. Again, just send me a message on Slack and we'll find a time that works for both of us.
