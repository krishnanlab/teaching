# Assignment 05
>Due: Wed, Dec 15 @ 11:59p  
>Send your response to Parts 1 and 2 to me via Slack.

## Part 1: Revisit the checklist on statistical analysis and reporting rigor
Early on, you completed an assignment on completing a analysis, reporting, and reproducibility checklist for a recent paper of your interest, focusing on one specific analysis/result.

For this assignment, I would like you to revisit that checklist (no need to redo it) and write a three–four paragraph reflection on what topics and ideas in that checklist that you have evolved in your mind in _some way_ as a result of the discussions in this class. In this reflection, please you include specific topics/ideas and, for each one you pick, talk about what way your thinking changed, perhaps along the lines of (but not limited to):
- correctly understanding something for the first time,
- improved/broader/deeper understanding,
- connections with your research or with papers that you have read
- your data analysis / research plans for the future
- communicating with your immediate research group or with the your scientific community

Please convert your response to a PDF and submit via Slack (direct message).


## Part 2: A creative expression
This second part is also meant to be a fun project. I'm asking you to submit some kind of creative expression of the most interesting, important, or relevant information that you learned in this class. The creative expression can be in the form of a meme, cartoon, artwork, blog/vlog post, ticktock, poem, claymation, short film, or anything else.

Please upload your creation either directly to Slack (direct message) or send me a link to the file (e.g., link to a dropbox, google drive, etc.)
