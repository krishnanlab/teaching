# Assignment 01

## Part 1: Complete the incoming survey
>Due: Wed, Nov 10 @ 11:59p

Complete the [incoming survey](https://bit.ly/statgaps2021_incoming).


## Part 2: Instal R or Python
>Due: Before class, Wed, Nov 10

If you are working and familiar with R:  
Install R, RStudio, and Tidyverse (package); Get familiar with R Notebooks

Or, if you prefer Python:  
Install Anaconda, Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebooks

Resources with detailed instructions are in the [preparatory materials](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-fall_statgaps/preparatory-materials.md) document.


## Part 3: Checklist on statistical analysis and reporting rigor
Many good scientific journals are now requiring authors to provide a detailed account of all their statistical analyses and data availability/access along with sufficient information for other scientists to reproduce the findings presented. You can get a quick sense of this checklist by looking at this [PDF](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-fall_statgaps/Assignments/StatGaps-Checklist.pdf).

The goal of this assignment is to give you the opportunity to complete such a checklist for a recent paper _relevant to your research_, focusing on one specific analysis/result.

### 3a: Choose a paper and a specific analysis
>Due: Wed, Nov 10 @ 11:59p

Select a primary research article published by you/your-group in the past 3–5 years that satisfies the following four criteria:
1. Has a specific question that is of interest to you.
2. Is based on experimental data (newly generated or previously published). Note: You DO NOT need to find and bring the original/experimental data behind the paper. Just make sure the results are based on an experimental dataset.
3. Contains a “Methods” section that contains the description of the methods to answer the specific question.
4. Involves at least 2 different results – described as figures/tables in the main paper – obtained based on statistical data analysis. [THIS IS CRITICAL.]

This article **“What is the question?”** ([PDF](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-fall_statgaps/Reading-materials/Leek-Peng-2015_What-is-the-question.pdf) in class website in the directory [Reading-materials](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/tree/master/2021-fall_statgaps/Reading-materials)) contains a description of different types of questions related to data analysis. Using the terms defined in this article, in the paper you picked, I suggest choosing a question that is Inferential, Predictive, Causal, or Mechanistic.

**Some notes**  
* I suggest choosing a paper authored by you or someone in your group. This is to make sure that the paper is relevant to your research and hence you already have a grasp of the science and terminologies.
* However, if you are having a hard time finding one that fits our criteria, please feel free to use a paper written by someone else in your field that is pertinent to your research interests.
* If you are a junior/developing scientist and if you are still not sure, I strongly recommend asking someone senior in your group (graduate student / postdoc / PI) for suggestions on a good paper.

As soon as you pick one, send me your paper of choice on Slack (via a direct message) also indicating which specific analysis/result/figure you’re planning to focus on and we can make sure the paper has enough statistical results to dig in.

### 3b: Complete the checklist for the chosen analysis in the paper
Due: Mon, Nov 15 before class

Complete the checklist in [this google form](https://forms.gle/rhvThxUazVtNxyFj7).


Let me know if you have any questions along the way (by messaging me on slack). Good luck!
