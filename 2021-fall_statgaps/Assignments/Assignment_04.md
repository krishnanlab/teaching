# Assignment 04
>Due before class next week, Dec 06

## Notes  
1. Download and work with the [R notebook Assignment_04.Rmd](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-fall_statgaps/Assignments/Assignment_04.Rmd) OR the [Jupyter notebook Assignment_04.ipynb](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-fall_statgaps/Assignments/Assignment_04.ipynb).
2. In your R or Jupyter Notebook, add your comments/annotations on the code and the results, along with your interpretation of the results and answers the questions (if any) at the end of each part. Export your notebook as a PDF and submit it via the [google form](https://bit.ly/statgaps2021_submit).
3. This assignment should not take more than 20 min. If you run into trouble, please do not hesitate to ask me or others in the class on Slack.

The assignment is on **Simulating the distribution of correlation coefficients** and it contains **two** parts:
1. Part 1 is about calculating correlation coefficients and what is a "significant" correlation at sample size of 10.
2. Part 2 is about repeating Part 1 at various sample sizes.

Again, don't worry about the specifics of the code. I am looking for your notes between code blocks that reflect your understanding of the statistical/quantitative ideas we discussed in class.
